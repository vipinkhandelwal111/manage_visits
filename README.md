# manage_visits
 Our idea is to a create a Web based system for a particular state.
 This will be a multifunctional online scheduling web page which enables users to request MoHFW to visit in their district or state.
  Here the user can easily request a visit of MoHFW staff and can also suggest some date or time according to his need.
 MoHFW staff will be able to confirm the visit requests and if somehow the staff is not available to visit then they can schedule/reschedule their visit.
A sorted list will be created which will have the details of all visits. 
  An sms based system will be there to inform the user about the details of schedule he had requested is possible. If not? New schedule will be informed. 

KEY FEATURES:
 Confirming/Substitute available schedule
 Requesting visits
 Management of schedule
 Suggest a timing (month, week etc)
 Past appointment Management
 Rescheduling visits.
